		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Hi, I'm Sam and I'm studying computer software development. When I'm not working with computers a lot of my free time is spent caring for my animals. 
			I have two aquariums, as well as a cockatiel! 
			Most of this page is probably going to just be me talking about my pets, but I might try to add info about some of my hobbies like illustration.

		<p>My cockatiel is the most energetic animal in my home.  He is filled with curiosity and loves to explore his environment by climbing and flying around.

	<h2 class="article">Community Aquarium</h2>
	
	<div class="content" style="padding-right: 25%;">
		<p>Maintaining an aquarium of any size can be pretty challenging.  An aquarium is basically a miniature ecosystem and a lot of variables have to be taken into account.  
   		 It usually takes a few months to finish setting up an aquarium from the time researching and planning, to actually building the aquarium.  I think that's part of the appeal,
   		 all the work and patience turning into something that all works together.  One of my aquariums is a community aquarium, meaning that there are multiple species living with each other.
   		 The tank mostly has cherry shrimp, small freshwater shrimp that get their name from their bright red color.  Along with the shrimp, there is a school of ember tetras.
   		 Both animals are not aggressive, live in similar water parameters and enjoy the cover of dense foliage.
